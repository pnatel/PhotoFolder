# PHOTO FOLDER

The application aim to create a sample from a pool of photos (folder) and copy a random sample to a destination folder. You can then use that destination folder as source for your Photo-Frames in your home network.

In the end it accomplishes a bit more than that.

If you are intrigued, have a look on the Wiki for more details.
